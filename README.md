## 1.- If you prefer download the file and run the markdown file, all library loading is included in the code
## 2.- The main interface has all variables loaded
## 3.- Eliminate all variables with high p-values in the lineal regression summary
## 4.- Check Breaush-Pagan test, if the value is above .05, then we can reject the null hypothesis and keep the p-values from our regression model
## 5.- Check Multicolinearity and ensure that all Variables have a VIF of less than 5, and corroborate that the variables are not correlated using the correlation plot
## 6.- Use the plots to ensure that your model adheres to the Markov-Gaussian principles for OLM
